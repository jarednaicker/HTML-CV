    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>I’m a driven student in my final year of undergraduate studies. I am a part of the Golden Key Honor Association, which only the top 15% of university students globally are able to join by invitation. I am passionate about people as I believe that I can interact with anyone. I’m someone who enjoys working in a team to achieve a common objective and in times of crisis I take the lead. Easily adaptable to new and changing environments with the ability to learn quickly as well. I possess good listening skills which is a key factor in communication skills and I believe that I can add value to any organization.</p>
